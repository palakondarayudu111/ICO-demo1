This explains about how to create ERC-20 Token

ERC-20 token is not a crypto currency as people think. It is just one 
token that can be created using Ethereum with few lines of code. 

ERC-20 standards force us to use few methods in creating token. 

The code here is just a basic code which most of tokens use in Ethereum,
but before making an official token and releasing it into prod, it's 
highly advisable to have security Audit on your smart contract 
if you don't want to loose your Ether by any kind of attacks.
